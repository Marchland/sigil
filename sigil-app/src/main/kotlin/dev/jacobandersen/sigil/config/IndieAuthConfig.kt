/**
 * Configuration for Sigil's IndieAuth provider.
 *
 * Sigil is an IndieAuth *provider*: it authenticates a browser session through
 * an [IdentityProvider][dev.jacobandersen.sigil.identity.IdentityProvider]
 * (GitHub, for now) and issues Micropub access tokens for exactly one identity -
 * the site owner identified by [me]. There are no local user accounts and no
 * username/password concept anywhere in Sigil.
 *
 * Because Sigil is API-only and hosts no UI, the browser-facing authentication
 * screen is delegated to a separate service ("Herald") through the [herald]
 * contract described in [HeraldConfig].
